* Ivory Tower Game

** This game aims to tell the player a story through the game's main mechanic
The main mechanic is to isolate the player from colors entirely. As the progress through the game they are 
given back certain colors one at a time which will allow them to find more solutions to previous puzzles.
Using the reveal of colors and common meanings associated with those colors we will control lighting,
environment, and music to portray emotions that the character is going through. We will also apply these
emotions into the puzzle mechanics themself to further enforce the idea of each chapter of the game

*** Color Representations

will change to better suit the game, tell a better story, and make it easier to understand the game
